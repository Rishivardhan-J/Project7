                    Hello! I'm Rishivardhan, a passionate developer with a solid foundation in programming and problem-solving. 
                    I graduated from Sri Eshwar College of Engineering, where I cultivated a deep interest in software development 
                    and honed my technical expertise. Proficient in C, Python, HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, I bring versatility 
                    as a full-stack developer. 
                </p>
                <p class="aboutme">
                    I excel at crafting efficient solutions, writing clean code, and collaborating effectively. 
                    My strengths include attention to detail, creativity, and a commitment to continuous learning. 
                    While I take time to adapt to new environments, I approach challenges with perseverance and a drive for excellence.
